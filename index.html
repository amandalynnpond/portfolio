  <!-- Introduction -->
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Pond! Although my first name is Amanda, most often I’m referred to as <i>Pond</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am software engineer student based out of Portland, Maine. While I am new to this subject, I am a very passionate learner and am excited to be on this journey to becoming a full developer! Please take a moment to browse my website and <a href="mailto: thatotherpond@gmail.com">reach out to me</a>.

    <!-- About Me -->
    <h2 class="section-title">About Pond</h2>
    <p>
      I started the Software Engineering Flex program at <a href=https://thinkful.com target="_blank">Thinkful</a> in October. I still have a long way to go as a developer, but I am enjoying the journey thus far thoroughly! Prior to this program, I have worked in specialty coffee as a wholesale manager and trainer. I believe these skills will translate into my future career by way of working in a thoughtful and communicative way with others. Coupled with Thinkful’s courses to sharpen my technical skills, I hope to become an asset to any team that I join.

      I volunteer for the United States Coffee Championships, where I am on the committee for the U.S. Latte Art Championship. I also livestream video games and Dungeons & Dragons on Twitch. Below, you can find my other hobbies:
